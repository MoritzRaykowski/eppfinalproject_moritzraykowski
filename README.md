I provide a comparison in data management/manipulation and regressions and their plotting between python and stata to see which utilities from each program might be missing in the other one and might be helpful for the future.


This repository contains the following:

    - a raw data excel file containing survey answers extracted from qualtrics
    - a stata do file for data mangement in which the raw data is polished, outputs a ready to be used dta file
    - a python file for data management in which the raw data is polished
    - a ready to be used dta file (stata) containing the survey data
