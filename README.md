I provide a comparison in data management/manipulation and analysis (regressions) and their plotting between python and stata to see which utilities from each program might be missing in the other one and might be helpful for the future.


This repository contains the following:

a raw data excel file containing survey answers from a survey experiment extracted from qualtrics
a stata do file for data mangement in which the raw data is polished, outputs a ready to be used .dta file for analysis
a python file for data management in which the raw data is polished, outputs a ready to be used .xls file for analysis
a stata do file for analysis calculating treatment effects for the survey data, outputs .jpg pictures of the regression results
a python file for analysis calculating treatment effects for the survey data, outputs .jpg pictures of the regression results
a .tex file in which I discuss the main differences I found between the used python libraries and stata
